# htmx4s

This project aims to provide some developer convenience utilities for
using [htmx](https://htmx.org) with scala.

It provides modules that build on each other, so it is possible to
pick what is appropriate for your case.

## htmx-constants

This module has no dependencies and simply provides constants around
htmx vocabulary as scala values. Using it you can use symbols instead
of strings.


## htmx-scalatags

Provides attribute definitions for htmx. Importing the custom bundle
gives access to all the htmx attributes.
